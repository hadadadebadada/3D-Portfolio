# 3D-Portfolio

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my 3D portfolio, a dynamic and interactive web experience crafted with Three.js, showcasing my professional works and projects. This portfolio combines the power of WebGL and CSS3D renderers to create a unique, immersive user experience. Explore it live at [arturpfeifer.com](https://arturpfeifer.com).

## Overview

This project aims to push the boundaries of online portfolios by leveraging the capabilities of Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library that creates and displays animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. The site features a blend of 3D models, animations, and interactive elements, all designed to present my work in the most engaging way possible.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Scenes:** Navigate through different sections of the portfolio in a 3D space, offering a captivating way to explore my projects and skills.
- **Dual Renderer Support:** Utilizes both WebGLRenderer and CSS3DRenderer from Three.js to integrate 3D objects with traditional web content seamlessly.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures an immersive experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Optimized Performance:** Carefully optimized to deliver smooth, high-performance graphics without compromising on visual quality.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js:** For creating and managing 3D graphics.
